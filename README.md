 ## Working 

 1. ### Firstly created a database in which all the emojis are listed in the form of objects and keys with their meanings
 2. ### Two eventHandlers are to be created 
    - ### One will handle the event in which user click the given emoji in emoji-we-know
       - ### second will handle the event when user inputs the given emoji in input section
 
 3. ### If the user clicks the emoji,it will show the corresponding meaning of that emoji in output section.(object.value)
